      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;being-brilliant-wont-make-you-a-good-leader&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Being Brilliant Won’t Make You a Good Leader&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#being-brilliant-wont-make-you-a-good-leader&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of my career, the mission was clear: contribute, solve, produce. The way to succeed was through output, and the way to feel valuable was by being the one who &lt;em&gt;figured it out&lt;/em&gt;. The job, unofficially, was to be brilliant. To know. To have good instincts. To deliver results directly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And if I’m honest, I enjoyed that clarity. The rush of solving a hard problem late at night. The satisfaction of being the one who unblocked a project. The little ego boost of being someone people came to with tough questions. It felt good to be sharp. It felt good to matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
